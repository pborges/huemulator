# HUEMULATOR
## A bare bones emulator library for the Phillips Hue bulb system

For use primarily for attaching home automation features to the Amazon Echo (Alexa)

### Acknowledgements
Thanks to armzilla for doing all the real work, and the killer name ([https://github.com/armzilla/amazon-echo-ha-bridge](https://github.com/armzilla/amazon-echo-ha-bridge))

I felt your implementation was alittle too heavy.

I wanted a library rather then a server for easy extensibility.

I wanted to remove alot of code that I felt was _voodoo_ magic.


### Example
see ```examples/habridge.go```
